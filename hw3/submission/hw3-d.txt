It is my first time using database manage system on azure, and the experience is
fantastic.
Maybe due to the web connection and limited memory use on the azure server, even
single linear queries (with O(n)) took couple of seconds to complete. Compare to
personal computer, operate database on web server is more expensive on time.
The advantage of DBMS on web server is conspicuous. It is more secure and convenient
to share datasource with others. Also, web server is a safe place to store and
operate trillions of data, which is possible crash personal computer.
